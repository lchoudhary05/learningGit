      In git a remote is like the url of the repository to which you want to
      connect.It can have different names when you first clone or create a
      repository then the alias to remote is setup to "origin" automatically or
      you if you follow the github comman then you setup the remote by alias
      "origin" by running command like this:"git remote add origin
      https://github.com/lchoudhary05/ecommerce.git". similarly if you want to
      pull or push from any other repo or you can say remote then you can setup
      another remote like this for example:"git remote add upstream
      https://github.com/original-owner/repository.git". Now to fetch the
      changes from different remote you can use: "git fetch upstream" command
      and to push your changes to different remote for example on new-feature
      branch of origin remote you can use:"git push origin new-feature".

      Today on 28th of Jan, 2025. I am using this code to connect it from my local 
      machine and push this paragraph code in it. I first cloned this repo in
      my local machine so that I don't have to add the remote and now I'm gonna
      push this code. In my other python learning project I'm going to connect
      by using git add remote command and I will practice ssh connnection in that
      for this psuh I'm using http connection"
